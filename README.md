# ANN
This is my own implementation for a feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN).  I have not written C++ in quite a bit, so pardon any distractions.


## Requirements

I compiled this using a Mac, and gcc (or really clang) version 4.2.1.  Other library requirements and versions will be listed as I continue this project.

## Compliling instructions.

If all requirements are satisfied, you can combile using the make file.  I will list how to compile using the makefile, and any specific instructions for test cases, etc as this project continues.

## Folder structure

**src**

The code for the ANN implementation.

**bin**

Binaries for the 

**tests**

Test cases for the code within the src folder.

**data**

Data I use potentially within the test cases, exmaples.

**examples**

Examples on how to utilize the ANN created.

## Implementation Notes

To be continued.
